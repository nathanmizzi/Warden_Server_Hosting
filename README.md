# Warden_Server_Hosting
A Personal Project is aiming to emulate the service that Aternos provides, with more perks.

The project consists of both a client-side website and a HTTP server backend, they both work in tandem to dynamically create
servers for games, and hosting it on an off-site machine, whilst giving the user full control of the server.

Currently, the project is still in early development stages, and is eventually expected to be hosted publicly,
with access being given to a select few users.
