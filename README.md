# Warden_Server_Hosting
A Personal Project aiming to emulate the service that Aternos provides, with more perks.

The prpject consists of both a client side website and a http server backend, they both work in tandom to dynamically create
servers for games, and hosting it on a off site machine, whilst giving the user full control of the server.

Currently the project is still in early development pages, and is eventually expected to be hosted publicly,
with access being given to a select few users.
